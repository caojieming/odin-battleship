# npm-webpack-template
Repository Template for npm Webpack projects.

Run `npm install` to install all packages/dev dependencies.<br>
Run `npm outdated` to check if any packages are outdated (can generally ignore yellow packages: current version is the wanted version, but not the latest version).<br>
Run `npm update` to update outdated packages.

## npm scripts included:
`npm run build`<br>
The equivalent of `npx webpack --config webpack.prod.js`.<br>
Bundles everything in `src` into `dist`.

`npm run dev`<br>
The equivalent of `npx webpack serve --config webpack.dev.js`.<br>
Opens a webpack server for viewing changes in real time without needing to build.<br>
Server link: http://localhost:8080/

`npm test`<br>
Runs all jest tests (see "./src/tests/model.test.js" for an example).

## To remove image file loader module:
This template includes the module "html-loader" for loading image files.

If you don't use image files, you can remove this module with:<br>
`npm uninstall html-loader`<br>
or<br>
`npm uninstall --save html-loader`

This command tells npm to remove the package from your `package.json`, `npm-shrinkwrap.json`, and `package-lock.json` files.<br>
The `--save` is optional in most cases (it's the default option).
